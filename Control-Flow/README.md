# Control Flow and Loops in JavaScript

## Control Flow

### 1. Sequential Execution
As we know By default, JavaScript executes statements in the order they appear in the code, from top to bottom.

### 2. Conditional Statements
   - **if Statement**: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
   - **else Statement**: Specifies a block of code to be executed if the condition in the if statement is false.
   - **else if Statement**: Specifies a new condition to test if the first condition is false.

### 3. Switch Statement
Evaluates an expression, matches the expression's value to a case clause, and executes the statements associated with that case.

### 4. Loops
   - **for Loop**: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
   - **while Loop**: Executes a block of code while a specified condition is true.
   - **do...while Loop**: Executes a block of code once before checking if the condition is true, and then repeats the loop as long as the condition is true.
   - **for...in Loop**: Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.
   - **for...of Loop**: Iterates over iterable objects such as arrays and strings.

### 5. Control Flow Keywords
   - **break**: Terminates the current loop or switch statement and transfers control to the statement following the terminated statement.
   - **continue**: Skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration.
   - **return**: Exits the current function execution and returns a value to the caller.

## Conclusion
Understanding control flow and loops in JavaScript is fundamental for writing efficient and reliable code. They allow developers to control the flow of execution and handle different scenarios effectively.
