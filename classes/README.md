# JavaScript Classes

## Introduction

JavaScript classes are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript. They provide a way to create blueprints for objects, enabling code reuse, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Basic Concepts

### 1. Introduction
   - Explanation of classes in JavaScript.

### 2. Creating Classes
   - How to define classes using the `class` keyword.
   - The role of constructors in initializing class instances.

### 3. Instance Methods
   - Defining methods within a class to perform actions on class instances.

## Intermediate Concepts

### 4. Class Members
   - Understanding class properties and methods.
   - How to access and modify class members.

### 5. Inheritance
   - Extending classes to create subclasses.
   - Using `extends` keyword for inheritance.

### 6. Getter and Setter Methods
   - Defining getter and setter methods to control access to class properties.

## Advanced Concepts

### 7. Static Methods
   - Definition and usage of static methods that belong to the class itself rather than its instances.

### 8. Polymorphism
   - Explanation of polymorphism in JavaScript classes.
   - How subclasses can override methods of their parent class.

### 9. Abstraction
   - Utilizing abstraction to hide complex implementation details and expose only essential features.

### 10. Encapsulation
   - Understanding encapsulation as a mechanism for bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a class.

### 11. Private Fields and Methods
   - Explanation of private fields and methods introduced in newer versions of JavaScript.

### 12. Class Expressions
   - Defining classes using class expressions, which can be named or unnamed.
