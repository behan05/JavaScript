### ES6 Introduce features: 

ECMAScript 6 (ES6), officially known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced many new features and enhancements to the JavaScript language. These features aimed to improve developer productivity, make code more expressive, and provide better support for writing complex applications. Here are some key concepts introduced in ES6:

### Arrow Functions:
Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions, especially for short anonymous functions.
They use the => syntax and automatically bind this to the surrounding context.

### let and const Declarations:
let and const are block-scoped variables introduced in ES6.
let allows for block-scoped variables that can be reassigned, while const allows for block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned.

### Template Literals:
Template literals provide a more flexible and readable way to create strings in JavaScript.
They allow for embedded expressions and multi-line strings using backticks (``) instead of quotes.

### Destructuring Assignment:
Destructuring assignment allows for extracting values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.
It provides a concise syntax for extracting multiple properties from objects or elements from arrays.

### Spread and Rest Operators:
The spread operator (...) allows for expanding arrays or iterable objects into individual elements.
The rest parameter (...) allows for representing an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

### Default Parameters:
Default parameters allow for specifying default values for function parameters if no argument or undefined is provided.

### Classes:
Classes provide a more concise syntax for defining constructor functions and creating objects with prototypal inheritance.
They introduce the class keyword, constructor method, and methods within the class body.

### Modules:
ES6 introduced a standardized module system for JavaScript, allowing for defining reusable code in separate files and importing/exporting modules.

### Enhanced Object Literals:
Enhanced object literals provide additional syntax for defining properties and methods within object literals.
This includes shorthand property names, computed property names, and method definitions.

### Promises:
Promises provide a cleaner and more robust way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
They represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow for chaining multiple asynchronous operations.

### Iterators and Generators:
ES6 introduced iterator and generator protocols, allowing for custom iteration behavior and lazy evaluation of data sequences.

### Map, Set, WeakMap, and WeakSet:
ES6 introduced new built-in data structures for handling collections of data, including Map, Set, WeakMap, and WeakSet.
